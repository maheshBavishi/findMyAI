                creators to showcase their innovations to a wide audience. To

                plans for tool submissions:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span>Basic Plan:</span> The Basic Plan is a simple way to get
                  started. It lets you add one of your AI tools to our list.
                  This means more people can find and use your tool. And if you
                  ever need assistance or have questions, our support team is
                  here to help.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Featured Plan:</span> If you want to really make your AI
                  tool shine, the Featured Plan is for you. For a whole week
                  (that's 7 days), your tool will be shown on the main page of
                  our website. It's like putting a spotlight on it! Not only
                  that, but it will also be placed right at the top of its
                  category This way, anyone looking for tools like yours will
                  see it first. Of course, you'll still have access to our
                  support team if you need anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Standard Plan:</span> The Standard Plan is a great
                  choice if you want a bit of everything. You can list one AI
                  tool, just like with the Basic Plan. But here's the cool part:
                  your tool will also get that prime spot on our main page for 7
                  days. And yes, it will still be at the top of its category
                  too. So, if you're looking for a solid mix of exposure and
                  visibility, along with support when you need it, the Standard
                  Plan has got you covered.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Submitting your tool is a simple process. After completing the
                payment, you will receive an email containing a link to submit
                your tool. Just click on the link and provide the URL of your
                tool, along with some basic information. Our dedicated team will
                handle everything else, ensuring that all details are accurate
                and complete.
